# GoNote - Your Private Markdown Knowledge Palace

GoNote is a desktop-grade Markdown management and editing service designed for modern creators, developers, and knowledge workers. It provides a feature-rich personal knowledge base, comparable to cloud-based note-taking apps, but with data that is **100% private**, all in the form of a **single, green executable**.

Say goodbye to tedious installations and privacy concerns about the cloud. With GoNote, a single click launches a Markdown creation and management center that is entirely under your control, accessible across all your devices.


## ‚ú® Core Features

*   **üöÄ One-Click Start, Green & Portable**: Whether on Windows, macOS, or Linux, a single executable file starts the complete service with no external dependencies.
*   **üîê Absolute Data Privacy**: All your notes, attachments, and configurations are stored on your own device. No data uploads, no privacy leaks.
*   **üóÇÔ∏è Native File System Management**: File operations within the app (create, rename, move) are perfectly synchronized with your computer's file explorer.
*   ** powerful Editor**: Deeply integrated with Vditor, supporting **WYSIWYG**, **Instant Rendering**, and **Split-Screen Preview** modes, with native support for advanced features like **flowcharts, Gantt charts, and mathematical formulas**.
*   **üì± Cross-Platform Responsive Experience**: Get an optimized experience whether you are on a desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.
*   **üõ°Ô∏è Automatic Backups**: A built-in, configurable automatic backup mechanism periodically packages your entire knowledge base and automatically cleans up old backups.
*   **üé® Open and Customizable**: Supports advanced settings through configuration file modification and even allows replacing the entire front-end to create your own custom skin.

## üèÅ Getting Started

### 1. Download

Download the latest version for your operating system from the project's **Releases** page.

### 2. Launch

1.  Extract the downloaded file to a dedicated folder where you want to store your notes (e.g., `D:\MyNotes`).
2.  **Windows**: Simply double-click the `.exe` file.
3.  **macOS/Linux**: Open a terminal, grant the file execution permissions, and run it.
    ```bash
    chmod +x ./gonote-linux-amd64
    ./gonote-linux-amd64
    ```
4.  On the first run, the program will output the default username `user` and a **random 6-digit password** in the command line window. Be sure to save this password.

### 3. Access

Open your browser, navigate to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), and log in with the credentials from the previous step to start using GoNote.

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

This project is divided into a Go backend and a Vue.js frontend.

### Backend (Go)

The backend is the core of the project, responsible for file handling, the HTTP service, and user authentication.

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory.
2.  Build:
    ```bash
    build.bat
    ```


### Frontend (Vue.js)

The frontend provides the entire user interface.

1.  Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>= 16.*) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed.
2.  Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
3.  Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```
4.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```
5.  Build for production (files will be output to the `dist` directory):
    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

## üôè Acknowledgements

*   The frontend of this project is modified and extended based on [Arya - Online Markdown Editor](https://github.com/nicejade/markdown-online-editor).
*   It deeply integrates the excellent browser-side Markdown editor **[Vditor](https://github.com/b3log/vditor)** and its Go backend **[Lute](https://github.com/88250/lute)**.
